            <section>
                <p>Hi! I'm Rowan, a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of California, Irvine.</p>

                <p>
                    I have spent most of my life in Poway, CA, and enjoy going to the beach,
                    rock climbing with friends, and building things in my free time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout my life, I have loved working with my hands and building things.
                    I have always been fascinated with how things work, and I love to take things apart and put them back together.
                    I also have a passion for learning and enjoy taking on new challenges.
                </p>
